# Peanut Butter, Jelly and Ducks
## The repo for the PBJ and Ducks streams on https://twitch.tv/purplehaxttv
### What is this?
During the programming 101 stream, we decided to take the PB&J exercise a step further. Instead of just 
psuedo code, we are going to actually build an app that will "make us a PB&J sandwhich....with ducks....."

### DUCKS? ON PB&J??????
No. No ducks will be harmed in the making of this application. But there will be ducks, nyxiiieee commands it :smile:

### How to use this repo
There will be a branch for each stream. There will also be branches for any cleanup done
between streams. The main will have been merged to the most recent stream. Eventually, 
a release will be created for each stream as well, to show some versioning control concepts as well.
